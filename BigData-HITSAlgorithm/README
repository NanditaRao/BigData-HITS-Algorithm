We used Amazon EMR to complete this assignment.

Step 1: We preprocessed the supllied data such that just the "From" and the "To" lines from each file got stored into a single file. We called this file "All data".

Step 2: We ran the Map- reduce task to get the number for all the email id's that appeared in From of all the emails(authorities) present in the dataset.

Step 3: We ran the Map - reduce task to get the number for all the email id's that appeared in To of all the emails(hubs) present in the dataset. 

We followed the word count model for both these tasks.

Step 4: We concatenated the results that were obtained in parts using the cat command on Hadoop.

Step 5: The obtained results are present in the output directory.
